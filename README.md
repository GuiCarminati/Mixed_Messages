# Mixed Messages

The goal of this project is to practice key concepts of Javascript and Git learned at the first modules of Back-end Engineer at Codecademy. The objective is to create a small program that outputs a random message from a list of saved messages. The theme for the messages I have chosen is "Bad Jokes".

## Planning for the Project

For this project I'm setting the folowing goals:

* Have a simple html page hosted localy to view the messages.
* This page should have a button for generating a "New Message", which when pressed should displayed one of the saved messages.
* The messages should be stored in a subfolder of the project in a .csv file
* The Javascript modules should interact with the index HTML page and read from the .csv file with the list of messages.
